* How to invoke protobuf (to generate Java classes)
Note: this was tested only in Arch Linux (as I can't be bothered to compile
protobuf for my Mac).

protobuf version 2.4.1 is expected! It is available through 'yourt'.
Just type
$ yourt -S protobuf

Invoke 'protoc' to compile 'NxCoreConfigEventProtos.porto'. It's a one liner for now
as I'm going to put it into a build script sooner or later.
To compile the protocol to java:

(export PROTO_SRC='src/main/resources/protobuf';
 export GEN_DIR='src/gen/c';
 protoc -I=$PROTO_SRC --cpp_out=$GEN_DIR $PROTO_SRC/NxCoreConfigProto.proto)
